# Introduction
This is an example activity which used Jupyter Notebook to extract data insights from schools in a fictional school district. The analysis performed is an example of the applications of Python and Jupyter Notebook in an educational context. The objective is to analyze the math and reading scores of every student in the county to help the school board and county mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
The required analyses are the following:
* District summary
* School summary
* Top performing schools (by passing rate)
* Bottom performing schools (by passing rate)
* Math scores by grade
* Reading scores by grade
* Scores by school spending
* Scores by school size
* Scores by school type

# Data set
This analysis is performed over the `schools_complete.csv` and `students_complete.csv` as provided during the Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey Data Analytics Bootcamp for the February - August 2020 term. The data sets can be found inside the `PyCitySchools` folder in this repository. These are data from the fictional school district meant to practice data anaytics capabilities using Jupyter Notebook.

# Code description
To replicate the results and run this code, make sure to have all the folder contents and run the Jupyter Notebook provided in the `PyCitySchools` folder.
